  title: Movk Mapbox — Declarative Mapbox GL v3 Component Library
  description: Compose maps, sources, layers, markers and controls declaratively with MapboxMap / MapboxLayer components and composables. Native Nuxt 4 module plus a Vite plugin for plain Vue. Ships 3D buildings, radar / diffusion / glow effects, fog / terrain / weather, Tianditu and WMS / WMTS basemaps, and multi-CRS localization.

transition: { duration: 0.6, delay: 0.3 }
---
Compose maps, layers, markers and controls declaratively with two-way `v-model` camera bindings. One component set works across Nuxt 4 and plain Vue + Vite, with built-in 3D buildings, dynamic effects, weather environment, and localization basemaps.

Core Features

#description
Declarative composition, context injection, and dual-mode runtime — from a simple basemap to complex 3D effects and localized tile services, adopt only what you need.

  #title
  Declarative Composition

  #description
  Compose maps, sources, layers, markers, popups and controls as components. State is the view — no more imperative add/remove boilerplate.

  #title
  MapboxContext Injection

  #description
  The root component provides context down the tree. Child components access the map instance, isLoaded, and whenLoaded() via useMap() — no id lookups needed.

  #title
  Camera Two-Way Binding

  #description
  v-model:center / zoom / bearing / pitch keeps camera parameters in sync both ways, with cross-route persistent support.
  :::

  :::u-page-feature{icon="i-lucide-layers"}
  #title
  Rich Layers & Effects

  #description
  Built-in circle / fill / line / symbol / fill-extrusion / heatmap layers plus clustering, buildings, raster and video layers. Overlay radar, diffusion, glow, ripple, migration, and trajectory dynamic effects.

  Environment & Weather

  #description
  Fog atmosphere, 3D lights, terrain, and temperature / rain / snow weather — combined with camera tilt for an immersive 3D scene.
  :::

  #title
  Localization Extensions

  #description
  Tianditu basemaps, WMS / WMTS services, mapbox-gl-draw integration, and WGS84 / GCJ02 / BD09 coordinate conversion via gcoord — all out of the box.

  #title
  Nuxt / Vue Dual Mode

  #description
  Works as a Nuxt 4 module and also provides @movk/mapbox/vite + vue-plugin, so the same components are available in plain Vue + Vite projects.

  Composables & Utilities

  #description
  Composables including useMap, useMapboxCamera, useMeasure, and useMapExport, paired with coordinate, buffer, geometry, and measurement utilities for progressive adoption.
